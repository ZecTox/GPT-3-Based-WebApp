<h3>First,</h3><h4> a web app that lets anyone come and use GPT-3 for a specialized purpose you come up with (ex. writing a movie script, coming up with ad copy, generating a love letter, whatever you want).</h4>
<h3>Second,</h3><h4> a Chrome Extension that lets people use your GPT-3 prompts on any website they want (ex. generate tweets right in Twitter, generate a cool post right in LinkedIn, generate landing page copy for the headline right into Webflow, etc).</h4>
